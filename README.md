# StudioOS

**AI-Native Operating System for Building Organizations**

Describe a project in natural language. StudioOS analyzes it, designs a complete organization (departments, roles, agents, tasks), runs the agents through a production pipeline with review and version control, and delivers the result — all traceable in a real-time dashboard.

→ You don't prompt an AI. You build a company of AI agents.

## Quick Start

### One command

```bash
./install.sh && make dev
```

### Manual

```bash
# Install
./install.sh

# Start (backend + frontend)
make dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000. Use API key `demo` for a no-setup experience.

### Docker

```bash
make docker-up
```

## Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `make install` | Install dependencies |
| `make dev` | Start backend + frontend concurrently |
| `make build` | Build frontend for production |
| `make docker-build` | Build Docker images |
| `make docker-up` | Start with Docker Compose |
| `make seed` | Seed demo project + generate website |
| `make clean` | Remove build artifacts |

## Configuration

All configuration is via environment variables (see `backend/.env.example`):

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `DATABASE_URL` | `sqlite:///./studioos.db` | Database connection string |
| `OPENAI_MODEL` | `gpt-4o-mini` | LLM model for strategic planning |
| `CORS_ORIGINS` | `http://localhost:3000` | Allowed CORS origins |
| `ENVIRONMENT` | `development` | `development` or `production` |
| `LOG_LEVEL` | `INFO` | Logging level |
| `OUTPUT_DIR` | `output` | Directory for generated websites |
| `ACP_SERVER_URLS` | (empty) | Comma-separated ACP server URLs for external agents |

### Frontend (API URL)

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` | Auto-detected | Backend API URL (see Codespaces section below) |

The frontend auto-detects the backend URL in order of priority:

1. `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` environment variable (explicit override)
2. GitHub Codespaces: constructed from the forwarded port URL
3. `http://localhost:8000` (local development)

WebSocket URL (`WS_BASE`) is derived automatically from the API URL.

## GitHub Codespaces

StudioOS runs in GitHub Codespaces with zero configuration.

### Quick start

1. Open the repository in Codespaces
2. Wait for the `postCreateCommand` to finish (runs `install.sh`)
3. In the terminal, start both services:

```bash
make dev
```

4. When prompted by VS Code, click **Open in Browser** for port 3000 (frontend).

Or manually open the **Ports** tab and click the globe icon next to port 3000.

### How it works

The frontend automatically detects it is running in Codespaces by inspecting the browser's URL (`*.preview.app.github.dev`). It constructs the correct backend URL to match the forwarded port 8000 — no manual configuration needed.

If behind a custom domain or proxy, set the environment variable explicitly:

```bash
# From the Codespaces terminal
echo "NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://your-custom-url" >> frontend/.env.local
```

### Troubleshooting

**Frontend cannot reach backend (ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED)**

The most common cause is the backend not running. Ensure both services are started:

```bash
# In one terminal
cd backend && uvicorn app.main:app --port 8000 --reload

# In another terminal
cd frontend && npm run dev
```

If the issue persists, check the **Ports** tab — make sure ports 3000 and 8000 are both forwarded and set to **Public** if you need access from outside the Codespace.

## How It Works

1. **Describe** your project in natural language
2. **Strategic Planner** (LLM or demo/Rule-based) analyzes and produces: objectives, constraints, risks, complexity, suggested departments — all stored as **Strategic Decisions**
3. **Organization Architect** designs the org structure (departments, hierarchy)
4. **Recruiter** & **Agent Factory** define roles (with summary, permissions, metrics, skills) and assign agents with initial tasks
5. Agents execute tasks and **commit work to git** on their own branches (`agent/{name}`)
6. **Review Layer** — worker submits output, reviewer approves or requests changes, lead merges. No task can reach final status without an approved review (review gate)
7. **Memory Graph** — all decisions, constraints, and artifacts are versioned and shared across every agent. Immutable: new versions append, values never mutate
8. **Event-Sourced Kernel** — every action emits a typed event persisted in an append-only event log, replayable for full traceability
9. **DAG Execution** — tasks with dependencies are topologically sorted and executed in parallel batches
10. **Pipeline Trigger** — `POST /pipeline/run` orchestrates the full flow: planner → architect → scheduler → executor → output generation
11. **Memory Replay** — reconstruct system state at any point from the event log via snapshot API
12. Preview results (generated site, git log, PRs) directly in the dashboard

## Memory Replay

System state can be reconstructed from the event log at any point:

| Method | Path | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| (built-in) | `MemoryReplay.get_snapshot(project_id)` | Build current state dict from all events |
| (built-in) | `MemoryReplay.get_snapshot_at(project_id, timestamp)` | State at a specific point in time |
| (built-in) | `MemoryReplay.replay(project_id)` | Raw ordered event list |

The snapshot includes: project info, strategy, organization, agents, tasks (with statuses), reviews, and memories.

## Agent Integration Layer

StudioOS separates governance agents (CEO, Directors, Leads) from execution agents (workers) via a protocol-agnostic integration layer.

**Architecture:**
- `AgentProviderInterface` (abstract) — `discover_agents()`, `assign_task()`, `get_status()`, `collect_results()`, `cancel_task()`
- Providers implement this interface: `NativeProvider` (built-in), `MockProvider` (dev/testing), `ACPProvider` (future), `A2AProvider` (future)
- `AgentRegistry` — central talent pool with auto-discovery, manual registration, and governance review (discovered → pending → approved)
- Capability-based search: `GET /agents/search?q=backend,python` finds best-matching agents

**Provider support:**

| Provider | Discovered agents | Status |
|----------|------------------|--------|
| Native (built-in) | Strategic Planner, Architect, Recruiter, Executor | Always available |
| Mock (dev) | Backend Dev, Frontend Dev, Content Writer | Local testing only |
| ACP (external) | Dynamic from ACP servers | Configurable via `ACP_SERVER_URLS` env var |

To test ACP integration locally, start the mock ACP server and main app:

```bash
# Terminal 1 — Mock ACP server
ACP_SERVER_URLS=http://localhost:9001 make dev

# Terminal 2 — Mock ACP server (separate)
python -m app.mock_acp_server
```

The mock ACP server runs on port 9001 and exposes 3 agents:
- `backend_dev` (backend, python, api, database)
- `frontend_dev` (frontend, typescript, css, ui)
- `writer` (writing, documentation, content)

## Event System (V8 Kernel)

Every mutation emits a typed event persisted in the `event_log` table:

| Event | Trigger |
|-------|---------|
| PROJECT_CREATED | Project created via API |
| STRATEGY_GENERATED | Analysis completed |
| ORG_CREATED | Organization designed |
| AGENT_SPAWNED | Agents generated |
| TASK_ASSIGNED / TASK_STARTED / TASK_COMPLETED | Task lifecycle |
| REVIEW_REQUESTED / REVIEW_APPROVED / REVIEW_CHANGES_REQUESTED | Review lifecycle |
| GIT_COMMIT_CREATED / PR_CREATED / PR_MERGED | Git lifecycle |
| MEMORY_CREATED | Memory node created |

Events are replayable via `EventStore.replay()` and the `event_log` table is the single source of truth for the system's complete history.

## DAG Execution

Tasks with `depends_on` dependencies are automatically topologically sorted. The `DAG` engine:
- Validates acyclic constraints
- Returns ready tasks for each parallel execution batch
- Prevents execution of tasks with unmet dependencies

## Deployment

### Production (Docker)

```bash
# Set environment variables
export CORS_ORIGINS=https://yourdomain.com
export ENVIRONMENT=production

# Build and start
make docker-build
make docker-up
```

### Reverse proxy (nginx)

Example nginx config for production:

```nginx
server {
    listen 443 ssl;
    server_name app.mydomain.com;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:3000;
    }

    location /api/ {
        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8000;
    }

    location /ws/ {
        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8000;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection "upgrade";
    }

    location /output/ {
        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8000;
    }
}
```

### Database migrations

For production, use PostgreSQL and Alembic for schema migrations.

## Development

```bash
# Backend (with hot reload)
cd backend && uvicorn app.main:app --port 8000 --reload

# Frontend
cd frontend && npm run dev
```
